      <p>In all applications, your motivation letter should advertise how your presence in the company can improve what we do. We can see your qualifications and experience in your CV; what we can’t see is how you would use them at Labster.</p>

        <p>Unsolicited applications are always welcomed, if you think you have what it takes to be a part of Labster! Please send information about yourself and what you do to maris@labster.com to learn more.</p>

                <h3>Small company = Small hierarchy</h3>
                <p>We’re a small team, which means a flat hierarchy. It’s a working environment Denmark is known for, but Labster encourages it tenfold. You’ll undoubtedly have lasting, important input on the direction of the company when you get to talk with the CEO daily.</p>
